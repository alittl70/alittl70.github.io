    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

   <h3>Lacoste</h3>
   <ul>
        <li>Contrast: The site uses strong visual contrast between background, text, and product imagery, making key elements like headings, buttons, and featured collections stand out clearly and guide user attention effectively.</li>
        <li>Repetition: Consistent use of typography, color palette (especially the signature green/white), button styles, and layout patterns creates a cohesive brand identity and predictable user experience across sections. </li>
        <li>Alignment: Content is well-aligned within a structured grid, with centered and evenly spaced elements that create a balanced, organized, and professional visual flow throughout the page. </li>
        <li>Proximity: Related items (such as product categories, images, and descriptions) are grouped logically, helping users quickly understand relationships between elements and navigate the page without confusion. </li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</h3>
   <ul>
        <li>Contrast: The website has weak contrast between text and background in several areas, making some content harder to read. Important elements such as headings and navigation do not stand out strongly, which reduces visual hierarchy and user focus. </li>
        <li>Repetition: There is limited consistent use of design elements such as fonts, colors, and layout patterns. The lack of repeated visual structure makes the site feel less cohesive and less professionally unified. </li>
        <li>Alignment: Many elements appear loosely aligned, with inconsistent spacing and positioning. This creates a slightly cluttered and unorganized layout that can make scanning and navigation more difficult for users. </li>
        <li>Proximity: Related information is not always grouped clearly, which can make it harder for users to understand relationships between sections. Better grouping of related content would improve readability and overall usability. </li>
   </ul>
